## 📖 Overview

VoiceMock is a **production-style voice agent** that puts you inside a realistic job interview. You hold a button to speak your answer, the system transcribes it, generates a contextual follow-up question using an LLM, converts the response to speech, and plays it back — all in under 3 seconds.

At the end of a 5-question session, you receive a detailed coaching summary covering clarity, structure, confidence, and filler-word usage.

**Why it exists:**
- Job seekers and students need a low-stakes way to practice spoken interviews
- Existing tools are either static question lists or text-only chatbots — VoiceMock is voice-native
- It demonstrates a complete, production-grade **voice agent loop**: `Audio Capture → STT → LLM → TTS → Playback`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

VoiceMock follows a **clean monorepo layout** with strict module boundaries between the mobile client and backend service.

### Design Patterns

- **Mobile:** Feature-first Flutter structure with `flutter_bloc` Cubit state machine as the single source of truth for interview flow
- **Backend:** Provider Adapter pattern with a central orchestrator pipeline (`STT → LLM → TTS`) and clean separation of routes / services / providers / domain / observability
- **API:** REST + wrapped JSON envelope `{ data, error, request_id }` on every response; short-lived TTS audio served via a dedicated fetch endpoint

### Data Flow

```
User holds Talk button
    → Audio captured locally (record)
    → POST /turn (multipart upload)
        → Deepgram STT → transcript
        → Groq Llama 3 → assistant_text + tts_audio_url
        → Deepgram TTS → audio bytes cached server-side
    → Mobile fetches GET /tts/{request_id}
    → just_audio plays response
    → Returns to Ready state
```

- API keys: **Deepgram**, **Groq**

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvishkaGihan/voicemock-ai-interview.git
cd voicemock-ai-interview
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (`services/api`)

```bash
cd services/api

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys (see Environment Variables section)

## 📡 API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

All JSON responses use the envelope format:
```json
{ "data": <payload>, "error": null, "request_id": "<uuid>" }
```

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/session/start` | None | Start a new interview session; returns `session_id` + `session_token` |
| `POST` | `/turn` | `Bearer <session_token>` | Upload answer audio (multipart); returns transcript, assistant text, TTS URL |
| `GET` | `/tts/{request_id}` | `Bearer <session_token>` | Fetch TTS audio bytes (short-lived cache) |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | None | Health check + diagnostic metadata |

### Error Object Format

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "stage": "stt",
    "code": "stt_timeout",
    "message_safe": "Transcription timed out. Please try again.",
    "retryable": true,
    "request_id": "uuid"
  },
  "request_id": "uuid"
}
```

Error `stage` values: `upload | stt | llm | tts | unknown`

Full API examples live in [`docs/api/`](./docs/api/).

## 🤔 Technical Decisions

### Why Flutter?
Cross-platform (Android + iOS) from one codebase with excellent audio plugin support (`record`, `just_audio`, `audio_session`). The Very Good Flutter App template gave us testing infrastructure and linting conventions out of the box.

### Why FastAPI + Python?
Deepgram and Groq both have first-class Python SDKs. FastAPI's async support keeps the pipeline non-blocking and its OpenAPI generation is automatic. Pydantic v2 enforces strict request/response validation at zero runtime cost.

### Why Groq for LLM?
Groq's inference hardware achieves sub-second token generation, which is critical for hitting the ≤ 3.0s P50 voice loop target. Swapping to another provider (e.g., OpenAI) is a one-file change via the provider adapter pattern.

### Why Deepgram for STT + TTS?
Nova-2 delivers high transcription accuracy at low latency. Aura TTS produces natural-sounding speech quickly. Using one vendor for both audio services simplifies key management and reduces API round-trip variance.

### Why in-memory sessions (no database)?
MVP guest-only sessions need no persistence. Server-authoritative in-memory sessions with TTL expiry keep the stack minimal, latency low, and operating costs near-zero. A Redis swap is a single-layer change when scaling.

### Why a two-step TTS fetch?
Separating `POST /turn` (JSON response) from `GET /tts/{request_id}` (audio bytes) lets the mobile client show the transcript and assistant text immediately, then stream audio — improving perceived responsiveness and enabling future streaming upgrades.

## 💡 Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Sub-3-second voice loop latency**
Achieving P50 ≤ 3.0s across STT → LLM → TTS required provider selection for raw speed (Groq inference + Deepgram), fine-tuned timeout budgets per stage, and a two-step response so the client isn't blocked waiting for audio bytes before showing text.

**Challenge: Audio state machine correctness**
"Double speak" (overlapping TTS) and UI freezes during state transitions were prevented by making `InterviewCubit` the single source of truth with hard guards — no concurrent recording + playback possible, and no UI boolean flags outside the state machine.

**Challenge: Stage-aware error recovery**
Generic "something went wrong" errors make voice apps feel broken. Each pipeline stage (`upload / stt / llm / tts`) produces a typed error with a `retryable` flag and `request_id`, so the UI can offer the right recovery action (retry, re-record, or cancel) and the user never sees a dead-end.

**Challenge: Privacy with audio data**
Raw audio is never persisted. Transcripts are scoped to the session and deletable. API logs redact PII. This design satisfies GDPR-aligned data minimisation without requiring a full consent management platform in the MVP.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** — remove push-to-talk friction; detect end-of-speech automatically
- **Streaming responses** — progressive STT + partial TTS to reduce perceived latency further
- **Role packs** — curated question banks for specific roles (React, Flutter, Product Manager, etc.)
- **Resume upload** — tailor questions to the candidate's actual experience
- **Session history & trends** — track improvement across sessions with charts
- **Redis session store** — replace in-memory store for horizontal scaling
- **Dockerize full stack** — `docker compose` for one-command local dev
- **Real-time barge-in** — allow user to interrupt TTS playback mid-sentence
- **Multi-language support** — accent coaching and pronunciation feedback beyond English

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- All client ↔ backend and backend ↔ provider traffic uses **HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)**
- Session tokens are signed with `itsdangerous` (signed opaque token with `iat`/`exp`)
- **Raw audio is never stored** — only transient upload handling during the pipeline
- Transcript logging is **disabled by default**; opt-in via debug flag
- Logs never contain raw audio and are scanned against a field allowlist for PII
- Basic **safety filter** rejects disallowed content with a stage-aware refusal response
- Rate limiting on high-cost endpoints (`/turn`, `/tts`) via `slowapi`
